# Hackathon Machine Learning in R

In our Machine Learning course we have to do a Hackathon with 30 students, our team finished in the first position of the leaderboard. The aim of this little project was to be efficient to find the better model in order to have the better and the higher accuracy.

We worked on Spotify dataset

This dataset contains audio features of tracks for a certain user from Spotify.

Every Track is labeled in the column target:

"1" means the user likes the track.
"0" means he doesn't like it.
This must be the learning task of your models.

Every observation corresponds to a track.

There is 16 columns in the dataset. 3 of them describe the track: track's name, artist, and the target.

The other 13 columns are the audio features of a track:

- acousticness.
- danceability.
- duration_ms.
- energy.
- instrumentalness.
- key.
- liveness.
- loudness.
- mode.
- speechiness.
- tempo.
time_signature.
valence.
